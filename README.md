# Starbucks Data Manipulation and Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the application of Python and pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The focus was on handling a raw CSV file, cleaning the data, and deriving meaningful insights through various steps. The project showcases key skills like correcting data inconsistencies, handling missing values, and saving the processed data for further analysis.

## Steps and Methodology
1. Saving the Initial CSV File
2. Loading Data with pandas
3. Exploring the Data Structure
4. Handling Missing Values (NaN)
5. Correcting Column Names
6. Sorting and Filtering Data
7. Grouping Data for Analysis
8. Analyzing Data Trends and Patterns
9. Saving the Cleaned Data
10. Reflecting on the Insights Gained

## Reflection
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data manipulation and analysis using Python and pandas. The first task involved saving the initial CSV file, marking the starting point of data analysis. This was a foundational step, as importing pandas as pd with enabled me to work with a raw text dataset.

Next, I began to explore and manipulate the data. Pandas provided a powerful toolkit for this. It was fascinating to see how these operations could quickly transform a cluttered dataset into something more organized and insightful by running certain code.

With the data now more manageable, I focused on cleaning it up—addressing missing values (NaN) and correcting column names. Handling NaNs was crucial for ensuring that my analysis would be accurate and reliable. By filling or dropping these missing values, I could maintain the integrity of the dataset. Correcting the column names was not an essential step, but one that made the data more visually presentable to the client changing this column title to match the standard set in other columns.

Through this experience, I’ve deepened my understanding of how data can be leveraged to inform decisions and drive actions. It’s a reminder that data analysis is not just about crunching numbers—it's about uncovering stories and insights that can make a real impact.
